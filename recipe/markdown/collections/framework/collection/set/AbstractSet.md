# AbstractSet

- Note that this class does not override any of the implementations from the AbstractCollection class. It merely adds implementations for equals and hashCode.

- The process of implementing a set by extending this class is identical to that of implementing a Collection by extending AbstractCollection, except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the Set interface
