# Set 

- More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element.

- The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the set.

- A special case of this prohibition is that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
