# Vector

- Vector is synchronized

- If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList in place of Vector.

- The Vector class implements a growable array of objects. the size of a Vector can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate adding and removing items after the Vector has been created.
