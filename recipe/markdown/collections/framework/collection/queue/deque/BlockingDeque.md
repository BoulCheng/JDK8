# BlockingDeque


- Like any BlockingQueue, a BlockingDeque is thread safe, does not permit null elements, and may (or may not) be capacity-constrained.
  
- A Deque that additionally supports blocking operations that wait for the deque to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the deque when storing an element.

- A BlockingDeque implementation may be used directly as a FIFO BlockingQueue. Comparison of BlockingQueue and BlockingDeque methods
